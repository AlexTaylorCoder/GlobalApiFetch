# GlobalApiFetch
The goal of this project is to be able to display any JSON API structure visually in multiple dimensions. For now, the maximum amount of dimensions displayed is 3, but the long-term goal of this project is to display as many dimensions as necessary according to the database's depth. This project utilizes the three.js library, the rest is vanilla javascript. This is a fun side project fun me, in which I wish to further my knowledge of the three.js library and 3d web development in general.
