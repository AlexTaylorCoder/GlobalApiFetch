# GlobalApiFetch
The goal of this project is to be able to display any JSON API structure visually in multiple dimensions. For now, the maximium amount of dimensions displayed in 3,
but the longterm goal of this project is to display as many dimensions as neccessary according to the database's depth. This project utilizes
three.js library, the rest is vanilla javascript. This is a fun side project fun me, in which I am wish to further my knowledge of the three.js library and
3d web development in general.
